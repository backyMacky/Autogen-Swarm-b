## Configuration

Update the `Config` class in SwarmOnline.py:
```python
@dataclass
class Config:
    OPENAI_API_KEY: str = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY', 'your-api-key-here')
    MODEL: str = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Your preferred model
    TEMPERATURE: float = 0.7    
    MAX_ROUND: int = 10        
    SECRET_KEY: str = field(default_factory=lambda: os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'secret-key'))
    ASSISTANT_ID: str = field(default_factory=lambda: os.getenv('ASSISTANT_ID', ''))
